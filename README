In order to use these source files you will need to put them into your IDE, which
will need Apache Groovy enabled( http://groovy-lang.org/download.html );
and associate them with  the following libraries

jcsp from
groovyJCSP from https://github.com/JonKerridge/groovyJCSP
phwclasses and junit from the folder libraryJars.

You will need to ensure that the java and groovy version of the libraries match
with the versions you are using in your IDE.  Jars from JCSP and groovyJCSP have been created for
various versions and combinations of Java and Groovy.

It should be noted that the exercises package imports code from the examples package
and this will need to be maintained in your IDE.

The line numbers shown in the code samples in the books will line up with the line numbers in your IDE.

A simple test to ensure that the software has been installed correctly is:
navigate from examples> src> c02> RunHelloWorld.groovy, which is a runnable script

Use the IDE to run the script and 'Hello World!' should appear in the console (without the ').
